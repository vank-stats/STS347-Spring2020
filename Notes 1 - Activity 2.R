# Question 1
# No output is produced with the first line. Type pi to view the output
pi <- 3.14
pi

# Question 2
# The first line is how to use c() to do this. alt_p is another option.
p <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)
alt_p <- seq(10, 40, 10)

# Question 3
# m will be a vector that looks like p but every value has 1 subtracted from it
m <- p - 1

# Question 4
# The first line stores 12 in y, the second line prints 12
y <- 5 + 7
5 + 7

# Question 5
# All three of these are ways to get a vector containing values 1 through 5
seq(1, 5)
1:5
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
