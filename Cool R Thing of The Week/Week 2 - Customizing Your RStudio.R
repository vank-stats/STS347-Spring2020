# You can customize the look of your RStudio by going to the Tools menu
# and then choosing Global Options. There are a lot of options you can change,
# but most are beyond the scope of our class. 

# One easy change that everyone can do is go to Appearance and choose an editor 
# theme that you like. For example, you may prefer to not have a white
# background (which can be hard on the eyes). You can also choose different
# highlight colors for functions, numbers, etc.

# Another option that promotes good coding practices is to choose Code
# on the sidebar, then click the Display tab at the top. Check the box that
# says "Show Margin". This will add a vertical line to your R scripts that you
# can use to make sure your lines of code don't go on too long. This makes it
# easier for others (and for you) to read your code.
