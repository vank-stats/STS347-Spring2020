# This thread on Twitter shows someone who was able to use ggplot to animate
# a version of the game Pac-Man. It is an ongoing process, so you can see him
# working on things like changing what direction Pac-Man looks and making the
# ghosts move throughout the maze as well.

# In the replies, someone else shared a gif they made using ggplot of the game
# Shoots and Ladders being played.
